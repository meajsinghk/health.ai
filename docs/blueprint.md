# **App Name**: Gia Health Assistant

## Core Features:

- AI Video Interface: Display a video of an AI persona (Gia) that provides health advice and support. Mimics the appearance of a live consultation.
- Real-time Chat Interface: Provide a chat interface next to the video, allowing users to ask questions and receive instant responses from the AI health assistant. The AI tool will reason whether to provide a health answer, a wellness tip, or ask a clarifying question.
- Message History: Retain the history of chat conversations so that users can review prior advice and guidance.
- Health Records Page: Create a separate page where users can view and manage their health records (mock data for this MVP).
- Page Navigation: Implement a navigation bar with links to the Health Assistant and Health Records pages.
- Persona Selection: Add quick access buttons to let the user easily change to different personas, i.e., therapist, sales rep, support or tutor.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gray (#121212) for a modern, sophisticated feel.
- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for accents, progress bars and active states. High saturation, provides great contrast to dark background and brings life and futuristic look.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D0BFFF) to create contrast and call to attention.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for both headlines and body text, ensure clear readability, modern clean appearance.
- Use simple, geometric icons with rounded corners. Icons will primarily be white or the primary blue color.
- Use a split-screen layout with the AI video on the left and the chat interface on the right.
- Subtle transitions and animations when switching between pages or when the AI persona is 'speaking'.
